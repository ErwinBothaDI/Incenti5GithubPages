Kiosk Groups allow us to group together multiple kiosks and configure the games that are attached to them.

By clicking the add kiosk button we are able to select which kiosks we would like to group together.

After all kiosks have been grouped together we can configure the kiosk settings for the group by selecting the appropriate kiosk group settings.

Kiosk settings allow us to configure what is shown on the kiosk as well as wether or not the tickets can be reprinted at that kiosk.
