Here we select and upload prizes for the Electronic Draw. In order to upload a new prize we need to select the upload button, this will open the file explorer where we can select and upload the desired prize media into the prize media repository.

Once a prize has been selected it can be further configured. The prize name can be changed, as well as the cost of the prize to the casino and the value of the prize to the customer.
