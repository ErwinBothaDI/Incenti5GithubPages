A new promotion can be created by giving the promotion a name, selecting or creating a custom rules template for the promotion to follow.

Once the promotion has been created, you are now able to add promotion items to the promotion. Promotion items define the type of promotion you are creating.

Inceti5 allows us to create Electronic draw, Incentivisor, Manual Draw and Vouchers as promotion items. Each of these are fully configurable.
